        <p>In the developmental stages, which are commonly from ages 5 to 10  years old kids are starting to develop their cognitive skill to think and reason.Starting to teach emotional intelligence in this age is beneficial for the kids that can help them control their emotions in their day to day life.Emotional intelligence is based mostly on emotions and sociable interactions these small interactions can change the perspective of the kid for good or bad that is why kids need to learn from a teacher,parent or guardian how to control or behave to their negative emotions to transform them into  positive ones.Emotional intelligence will help every student on their personal and emotional development.Kids absorb information and process it how they were teached if they are teached what is good and what is bad depends on the teacher or guardian therefore for someone to teach about emotional intelligence they themselves need a high emotional intelligence which means being patient,social and careful to be able to teach others.The official integration of a national emotional intelligence program will reinforce and teach kids how to manage their emotions and actions that will have better control on how they act and think.Emotional intelligence helps to understand others people emotions and not say or do anything that can hurt other people therefore it can greatly decrease putting others down that can really interfere with a kids happiness.</p>
